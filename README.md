# My Genotype ðŸ§¬

## SNP Source
This is my genome as sequenced by ancestry.com for their ancestryDNA service. Feel free to git *clone* and do some analysis. If we're related or I'm going to get some obscure genetic disease, please let me know in a pull request.

## License
You can pretty much do whatever but please don't sell my genome ðŸ™ƒ

### Additional License Note
I couldn't find a specific license provision for this, but for posterity:

tl;dr: If you clone me you have to open source my clone's code.

```
Any algorithm, neural network, tensor model, future artificatial intellegence model, program, or entity created from this data, as well as any creative copyrights owned or created by such entities or works shall be subject to the same license.
